Ans : -2, 3, 1, 1
/*Step 1: int i=-3, j=2, k=0, m; here variable i, j, k, m are declared as an integer type and variable i, j, k are initialized to -3, 2, 0 respectively.

Step 2: m = ++i && ++j && ++k;
becomes m = -2 && 3 && 1;
becomes m = TRUE && TRUE; Hence this statement becomes TRUE. So it returns '1'(one). Hence m=1.

Step 3: printf("%d, %d, %d, %d\n", i, j, k, m); In the previous step the value of i,j,k are increemented by '1'(one).

Hence the output is "-2, 3, 1, 1". */

Ans : fff8

/*The integer value 2 is represented as 00000000 00000010 in binary system.

Negative numbers are represented in 2's complement method.

1's complement of 00000000 00000010 is 11111111 11111101 (Change all 0s to 1 and 1s to 0).

2's complement of 00000000 00000010 is 11111111 11111110 (Add 1 to 1's complement to obtain the 2's complement value).

Therefore, in binary we represent -2 as: 11111111 11111110.

After left shifting it by 2 bits we obtain: 11111111 11111000, and it is equal to "fff8" in hexadecimal system.*/

Ans : -2, 2, 0, 1
  
/*Step 1: int i=-3, j=2, k=0, m; here variable i, j, k, m are declared as an integer type and variable i, j, k are initialized to -3, 2, 0 respectively.

Step 2: m = ++i || ++j && ++k; here (++j && ++k;) this code will not get executed because ++i has non-zero value.
becomes m = -2 || ++j && ++k;
becomes m = TRUE || ++j && ++k; Hence this statement becomes TRUE. So it returns '1'(one). Hence m=1.

Step 3: printf("%d, %d, %d, %d\n", i, j, k, m); In the previous step the value of variable 'i' only increemented by '1'(one). The variable j,k are not increemented.

Hence the output is "-2, 2, 0, 1". */

Associativity has no role to play unless the precedence of operator is same.
  
Ans : True

In the expression a=b=5 the order of Assignment is NOT decided by Associativity of operators

Ans : False
